This project is a simple Java web application that demonstrates basic form handling using servlets. It includes an `index.html` form for adding student details, processed by `StudentServlet.java`, which validates the input and returns an HTML response based on the provided grade. The `LastResult.java` servlet displays a mock report card, while `LoggingFilter.java` logs request details for debugging. The project showcases session management, HTML form processing, and basic servlet filtering. The `home.html` page provides a playful welcome message. Ideal for beginners learning Java web development with servlets and filters.
